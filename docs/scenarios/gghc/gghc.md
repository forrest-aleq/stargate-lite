Task Name: Power BI → Excel → Journal Entry Allocation

Quote: “I have to go into so we have, Power BI reports. Right? Business reports, business analytic reports. I get a file from there. I then to sort through the data and similar process to what you’re describing. Right? Just a different data format. And then I export into Excel, then I take the Excel sheet, and then there’s other data reports coming from other third parties where I kinda have to match things up. And then all that kinda translates into some allocation logic of percentage base. So I have some engine that’s a fees of of percentage logic that I have to apply. And then it’s the output, and then that output needs to turn into a journal entry. Right? Ultimately, I’m keying in those numbers, you know, like, twenty twenty rows into the NetSuite.”
